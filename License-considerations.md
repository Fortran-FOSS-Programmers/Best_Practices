# Licensing considerations for your F/OSS Fortran project
> Please see [issue #9](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/Best_Practices/issues/8 for a discussion,
and work from that discussion to populate this document

Please note that
there is no "one-size-fits-all" software license, and picking an appropriate license is a personal choice.
The license chosen will have impacts (both theoretical, and practical) on how the software is used, how it
can be used, and by whom. Recommending specific licenses is beyond the scope of this document, and we will
abstain from doing so. *We will strive to be as unbiased and factual as possible in discussing different
licensing options*.

## Licensing resources
Choosing an appropriate license for your Free/Open Source Software can be a daunting process. Here are some
resources to help get you up to speed on commonly used licenses, and how to use them.

 ## Licensing code snippets and project documents and documentation
 The source code of a software project should be licensed using a license appropriate to the specific needs of
 the project and project authors. Often, however, these licenses might not be appropriate for other documents
 included in the project, such as:
 
  - Project documentation
  - Project artwork
  - Other non-software project assets
  
  In addition, these documents and assets may include code snippets, which themselves may need to be released under
  an additional (usually more permissive) license.
